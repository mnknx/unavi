## Usage

Simply register the extensions you want with your glTF-Transform `io` instance:

```typescript
import { NodeIO } from "@gltf-transform/core";
import { ColliderExtension, SpawnPointExtension } from "@unavi/gltf-extensions";

// Register extensions
const io = new NodeIO().registerExtensions([
  ColliderExtension,
  SpawnPointExtension,
]);

// Read from URL
const document = await io.read("path/to/model.glb");

// Write to byte array (Uint8Array)
const glb = await io.writeBinary(document);
```
